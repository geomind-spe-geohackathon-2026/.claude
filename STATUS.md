# Status: read first, keep current

The short, current state every session needs. Read it at the start of every session. When any of
it changes, change it here at once (one line, with the UTC time), before you go on.

Last updated: 2026-11-05 00:10 UTC.

## Production (geomind.team, api.geomind.team, on the NTNU Dell)

- Backend 1.1.56 (2026-11-05 00:08 UTC, hotfix-python-II): geomind 0.4.56 LOCAL wheel (skills folder `geomind/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with roles; `calculate` tool, results in problem state `calculations`), gemini 0.6.5.

- Backend 1.1.56 (2026-11-05 ~00:15 UTC, skills folder + calculate; 1.1.55 sandbox worker): geomind 0.4.56 as a LOCAL wheel,
  gemini 0.6.5, alembic 0014. Deploys resume running runs (QA-035; 21:00 and 21:30 resumed all).
- Frontend 1.1.50 (deployed 2026-11-04 21:08 UTC). Hotfix sessions deploy themselves with two calls:
  `cd <repo>`, then exactly `scripts/hotfix_deploy.sh`.
- Agents: every role on `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017`, OpenRouter provider `morph/fp8` first
  (`GEOMIND_PROVIDER=morph/fp8`), since 2026-11-04 20:20 UTC; `GEOMIND_CONTEXT_WINDOW=200000`.
  Never a Claude model.

## Clones (project root, one clone each, no worktrees)

- `.claude` (this, agents) and `documents` (people) are repos too, on `main`; set up a machine with `.claude/setup.md`.

- backend, frontend, geomind, infrastructure on `main`; gemini on `dev` (its default branch).
- No worktrees anywhere (removed 2026-11-04 20:30 UTC). Old local files: `~/geomind-archive/`
  (screenshots, QA screenshots of 2026-11-03, the old root git); DB backups `~/geomind-backups/`.

- Knowledge re-seeded by Sahand 2026-11-04 ~23:35 UTC with geomind 0.4.52 cost-sources (153 sourced
  rows). No row yet for opex.per_energy of the three chillers and opex.fixed.adsorption_chiller.

## How we work now

- Mode: ask the user at the start of every session (development, production, hotfix);
  `documents/project/ops/development-modes.md`. Current mode of the last session: hotfix.
- QA: testing the live app; every bug in `documents/project/quality-assurance/BUGS.md` (QA-001 to QA-019; statuses there,
  QA-007 blocker: ask_economics fails again and again); ideas in `IMPROVEMENTS.md` (IMP-001 to IMP-011,
  QA-010 and IMP-006 need Sahand's decision). Run a61cfb19 was left `waiting` with no process after the 20:02 UTC deploy (QA-017).
- No file holds Persian text; chat with the user in Persian.
- Commit and push everything when a piece of work ends.

## QA round (started 2026-11-04 20:00 UTC)

- Hotfix sessions resumed 2026-11-04 20:25 UTC (paused 20:10-20:25). Deploy windows at :00 and :30 UTC
  only (a blocker may go at once); every deploy still ends running agent runs until QA-035.

- Coordinator: Coordinator-II, session_01J2V3UXD6UT73meeapsG2MS (since 2026-11-05 00:20 UTC; opens and
  closes the sessions, sends reports). Generation 1 (session_01J2V3UXGweG4JrR4wkEWtg9) archived;
  its handover note is `notes/sessions/coordinator-1.md`.
- Hotfix sessions (who fixes what: `documents/project/quality-assurance/README.md`):
  hotfix-front (session_01J2V3UYxh6obK4VSajGwZvk, area frontend, frontend clone),
  hotfix-back (session_01J2V3UWh6RugyR1DAxrkNhH, areas backend, data, infra, backend clone),
  hotfix-python-II (session_01J2V3UXSA2mo8MG4igf5y4n since 2026-11-04 23:52 UTC, areas geomind, gemini; local wheels).
  They claim with `qa.py next`, take `/tmp/geomind-backend.lock` before editing the backend, and
  deploy with `scripts/hotfix_deploy.sh` (one deploy at a time).
- QA sessions qa-1, qa-4, qa-5 paused by Sahand 2026-11-04 23:25 UTC and ARCHIVED ~23:30 UTC;
  their state is in `notes/sessions/qa-paused-2026-11-04.md`. QA round 2 started 2026-11-04 23:36 UTC (briefs `notes/qa-round-2/`, agent-browser only):
  all on Sonnet since 23:45 UTC (only hotfix sessions on Opus):
  qa-func-1-II session_01J2V3UWQ5zYo1TfCiAKXF4d (chat + case), qa-func-2-II session_01J2V3UYJGYnJTqhfgaSGAWw
  (design + simulation), qa-func-3-II session_01J2V3UW9DXpV2MR9cERLnwW (economics, scoring, report),
  qa-ux session_01J2V3UYjXaURZYEzofAQh3n (UI/UX). Their Opus first generations are archived. (Started 2026-11-04 20:11 UTC; instructions in `notes/qa-round-2026-11-04/`):
  qa-1 session_01J2V3UXnAof6WqpiA2JPxxG, qa-2 session_01J2V3UYuCFrxrXdWLCwzWro,
  qa-3 session_01J2V3UWmkUwP3g42jGxxz9g, qa-4 session_01J2V3UZkFGKUyXLCP3gYmk4,
  qa-5 session_01J2V3UVCHoDxQNsjwpBxtzH, qa-6 session_01J2V3UXM3DCMhq41Hx27eqV,
  qa-7 session_01J2V3UVMbdhwimT6VJxfNMq, qa-8 session_01J2V3UW8MS1wyUTdvJmh8UC.

- TEMPORARY for the QA round: prod backend `.env` has `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=1000` (was 100; all QA
  sessions share the admin account, QA-024). Set it back to 100 after the round (Fatemeh runs it;
  backup `~/env.backend.before-ratelimit.bak`).
- `~/.claude/settings.json` allows `scripts/hotfix_deploy.sh` (added by Fatemeh 2026-11-04 20:35 UTC).

## Feature in progress (hotfix mode)

- Since 2026-11-05 ~00:00 UTC: skills folder + calculate, run_python, web_search/read_web_page (SearXNG);
  spec `notes/features/agent-tools-2026-11-05.md`; hotfix-python, hotfix-back, hotfix-front.
- 2026-11-05 ~00:15 UTC (Sahand): SearXNG up (geomind-searxng, geomind network only), image
  gemini-sandbox:0.6.5 built, prod backend `.env` has GEOMIND_SEARCH_URL, DOCKER_GID, ASSISTANT_SANDBOX,
  GEOMIND_SANDBOX_* (backup `~/env.backend.before-sandbox.bak`). Worker change deploys next (hotfix-back).

## To do in development mode after the QA round

- Backend `requirements.txt` still pins geomind 0.4.26; production runs local wheels (geomind up to
  0.4.41) from `backend/.tmp/hotfix-wheels`: pin the released version, empty the folder.
- Frontend `src/api/schema.d.ts` was patched by hand for QA-040 (1.1.49): run `npm run gen:api` and
  review the ~1100-line diff.
- Set the prod backend `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS` back to 100 (QA round only).
- Run every automated test that needs no LLM in every repo; the hotfixes ran none.
- QA-011 (resume a nested run after a provider failure), QA-013 (IMP-001) and QA-047's record of
  half-done engineer work are development work.
- QA-045's data part: three catalogue rows need a person-approved price year, then a Knowledge
  re-seed.

## Open decisions (waiting for Sahand)

Decided 2026-11-04 21:40 UTC: QA-010 option A (agent proposes labelled assumptions in one question,
user approves; hotfix-python), QA-006 option A (research cited rows, Sahand approves, then re-seed;
hotfix-back writes proposed rows to evidence/QA-006/).

Still open (Sahand answers later; the full write-up is in the coordinator's chat of 21:35 UTC):
3. QA-045 data: three rows in USD/FRF with no price year. Proposed: leave them (the tool skips
   them now), convert after the hackathon.
4. gemini requests 33-38 (geomind `.claude/docs/plan.md`, none sent). Proposed: approve 36
   (check names params.backup), 38 (dimensionless % accepted), 33 (check vs simulate); the rest later.
5. QA-031: auto-approve with no tab open needs a backend setting per chat. Proposed: build it.
6. A development round after QA for QA-011, QA-013 (IMP-001), QA-047.
7. geomind tags v0.4.27-v0.4.45 were pushed and released by CI during the hotfix round (the rule
   was "release only on Sahand's word"); prod runs the local 0.4.45 wheel; pin it in development.
8. Set prod `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS` back to 100 after QA (now counted per browser since QA-024).
9. Done 2026-11-05 00:20 UTC: Coordinator-II is running (handover was automatic).
